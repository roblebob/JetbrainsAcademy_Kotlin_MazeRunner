<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>The Resistance is organizing ships to confront the Empire. R2D2 has a list with the ships. The Resistance will attack in groups of 3 ships, but there could probably be a group with fewer ships. The droid should get a list with the average of the ammunition for each group of ships. You must code R2D2's AI to print a single list that solves this problem to organize the defense against the Empire.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">XWing-100 YWing-200 TWing-50 TIEFighter-300<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">[116, 300]<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
