<h2>Rewiew code</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>A student wrote code that does not compile, and we were asked to do a code review. Find the error in the code and fix it so that the code works correctly. In this code, the student tried to create a base class with a private property and function, as well as a successor class that calls the private function of the base class.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
