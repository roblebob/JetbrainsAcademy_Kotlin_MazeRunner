<h2>So you want to build a dog... out of interfaces</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Suppose you're provided with the following interfaces...</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">interface Animal {}

interface Fish : Animal {}

interface Bird : Animal {}

// Has the capacity to bite
interface Biting {}

// Has the capacity to purr. As cats do.
interface Purring {}

// Has the capacity to bark!
interface Barking {}

// Has the capacity to move
interface Moving {}

// Has the capacity to walk
interface Walking : Moving {}

// Has the capacity to fly
interface Flying : Moving {}

// Can walk upright, using 2 limbs
interface Bipedal : Moving {}

// Has the capacity of intelligible speech
interface Talking {}</code></pre>
<p>Which of them would you implement when programming a <code class="language-kotlin">Dog</code> class? </p>
